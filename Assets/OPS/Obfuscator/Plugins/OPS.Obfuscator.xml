            Add this to class members to obfuscate them anyway with a new name '_ObfuscateTo', although the settings did not allow to.
            For example if you do not want to obfuscate all public methods beside some specific.

            <summary>
            Add this to a Class, so the whole class with all its content will not get obfuscated! 
            But still its Method Bodys (String Obfuscation, Random Code generation ...)
            To not obfuscate Method Bodys too, add an additional Attribute: DoNotObfuscateMethodBodyAttribute to the classes or the specific methods.

            <summary>
            Add this to an Class to skip obfuscation of all Method Bodys, or to an specific Method to skip its Method Body.
            String Obfuscation, Random Code generation, ... are part of the Method Body obfuscation.
